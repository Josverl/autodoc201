          or a mutable buffer, which will be filled with received bytes.
        - ``timeout`` is the timeout in milliseconds to wait for the receive.

      Return value: if ``data`` is an integer then a new buffer of the bytes received,
      otherwise the number of bytes read into ``data`` is returned.



   .. py:method:: send(data) -> None

      Send data over the USB HID interface:

        - ``data`` is the data to send (a tuple/list of integers, or a
          bytearray).
