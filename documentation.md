## Autodoc-Style Directives

You can opt to write API documentation yourself using autodoc style directives. These directives work similarly to autodoc, but docstrings are retrieved through static analysis instead of through imports.
For Python, all directives have an autodoc equivalent and accept the same options. The following directives are available:

.. autoapimodule::
.. autoapiclass::
.. autoapiexception::

Equivalent to automodule, autoclass, and autoexception respectively. autodoc_inherit_docstrings does not currently work.

.. autoapifunction::
.. autoapidata::
.. autoapimethod::
.. autoapiattribute::

Equivalent to autofunction, autodata, automethod, and autoattribute respectively.

see: https://sphinx-autoapi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/directives.html


.. autoapimodule:: array
    :noindex:
    :members:
    :undoc-members:
    :private-members: 

    :special-members:



    :exclude-members: __init__, __weakref__

.. restore_section::


   .. autoapiclass:: btree
        :noindex:
        :members:
        :undoc-members:
        :private-members: 
        :special-members:
        :show-inheritance:



### check example codeblocks for \n or \n 

all special charactes should have an extra `\` so `\n` should be `\\n`


### move class __init__ methods to the first method in the class
stubber places the `__init__` method at the end of the class, but it is more common to see it at the top of the class
Apparently autoAPI assumes __init__ is always the first method in the class, so it is better to move it there
if not the class will not be documented properly


# to we keep all the modulee pages generated by autodocs ?

Currently the library pages mix regular documentation and module/class documation in the same page 
This is not ideal, as the module/class documentation is not easily accessible

There are multiple options to fix this:
1) keep the Why and How parts of the page and add links to  to the autoapi module or class pages in the autodocs
2) remove the autodoc pages and only use the autoapi pages
