Module Contents
---------------

.. py:class:: Accel

   Create and return an accelerometer object.


   .. py:method:: filtered_xyz() -> Tuple

      Get a 3-tuple of filtered x, y and z values.

      Implementation note: this method is currently implemented as taking the
      sum of 4 samples, sampled from the 3 previous calls to this function along
      with the sample from the current call.  Returned values are therefore 4
      times the size of what they would be from the raw x(), y() and z() calls.



   .. py:method:: tilt() -> _typeshed.Incomplete

      Get the tilt register.



   .. py:method:: x() -> _typeshed.Incomplete

      Get the x-axis value.



   .. py:method:: y() -> _typeshed.Incomplete

      Get the y-axis value.



   .. py:method:: z() -> _typeshed.Incomplete

      Get the z-axis value.
