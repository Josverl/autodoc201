.. py:class:: Flash

   Create and return a block device that represents the flash device presented
   to the USB mass storage interface.

   It includes a virtual partition table at the start, and the actual flash
   starts at block ``0x100``.

   This constructor is deprecated and will be removed in a future version of MicroPython.
