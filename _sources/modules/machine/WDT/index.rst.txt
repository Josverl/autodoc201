.. py:class:: WDT(id=0, timeout=5000)

   Create a WDT object and start it. The timeout must be given in milliseconds.
   Once it is running the timeout cannot be changed and the WDT cannot be stopped either.

   Notes: On the esp8266 a timeout cannot be specified, it is determined by the underlying system.
   On rp2040 devices, the maximum timeout is 8388 ms.


   .. py:method:: feed() -> None

      Feed the WDT to prevent it from resetting the system. The application
      should place this call in a sensible place ensuring that the WDT is
      only fed after verifying that everything is functioning correctly.
