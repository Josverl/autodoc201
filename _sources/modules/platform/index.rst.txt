   Access to underlying platform’s identifying data.

   |see_cpython_module| :mod:`python:platform`.

   This module tries to retrieve as much platform-identifying data as possible. It
   makes this information available via function APIs.

   platform.python_compiler


Module Contents
---------------

.. py:function:: libc_ver() -> Tuple

   Returns a tuple of strings *(lib, version)*, where *lib* is the name of the
   libc that MicroPython is linked to, and *version* the corresponding version
   of this libc.


.. py:function:: platform() -> str

   Returns a string identifying the underlying platform. This string is composed
   of several substrings in the following order, delimited by dashes (``-``):

   - the name of the platform system (e.g. Unix, Windows or MicroPython)
   - the MicroPython version
   - the architecture of the platform
   - the version of the underlying platform
   - the concatenation of the name of the libc that MicroPython is linked to
     and its corresponding version.

   For example, this could be
   ``"MicroPython-1.20.0-xtensa-IDFv4.2.4-with-newlib3.0.0"``.


.. py:function:: python_compiler() -> str

   Returns a string identifying the compiler used for compiling MicroPython.
