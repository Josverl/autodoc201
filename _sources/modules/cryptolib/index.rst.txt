.. py:class:: aes(key, mode, IV: Optional[Any] = None)

   .. py:method:: decrypt(in_buf, out_buf: Optional[Any] = None) -> _typeshed.Incomplete

      Like `encrypt()`, but for decryption.



   .. py:method:: encrypt(in_buf, out_buf: Optional[Any] = None) -> _typeshed.Incomplete

      Encrypt *in_buf*. If no *out_buf* is given result is returned as a
      newly allocated `bytes` object. Otherwise, result is written into
      mutable buffer *out_buf*. *in_buf* and *out_buf* can also refer
      to the same mutable buffer, in which case data is encrypted in-place.
